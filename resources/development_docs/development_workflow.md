## Warmshowers.org Development Workflow

Github has a very nice ["Pull Request" workflow](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
that allows everybody to work in their own environment, but changes can be pulled
by the maintainer when they're ready.

The basic idea is:

1. Refresh/update your own environment from the upstream repository (github.com/warmshowers/Warmshowers.org)
2. Create a new branch for the work you want to do.
3. When it is ready to share, push the branch to your repository
4. Create a pull request from your pushed branch

Then you may end up making additional commits to the branch/pull request, and others
can collaborate as well.

As always, please make sure that you work on one discrete issue in one issue or pull request.
