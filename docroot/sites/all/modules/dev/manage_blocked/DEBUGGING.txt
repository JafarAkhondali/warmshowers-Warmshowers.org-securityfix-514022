Debugging and testing Manage_blocked

There are a number of issues when you want to test out this module. You can't just 
assume it's working.

Dummy SMTP environment

You need to have an SMTP environment that lets you send mail without really sending it.
I use fakemail (http://www.lastcraft.com/fakemail.php), which is a perl script
that pretends to be an SMTP daemon, sitting on port 25 and receiving mail. But it just
dumps it into a directory as files instead.

You need to have PHP set up successfully to send mail. On Ubuntu, you need something that
provides /usr/sbin/sendmail, since that's what it uses to send mail. But you don't want
the normal SMTP agent running. So you can have sendmail installed, for example, but
don't start it.  Exim seems to queue the mail rather than trying to deliver it to the 
MTA right away, so it didn't work for me.

Another simple technique if you're using gmail is to change all the emails in your
database (you are working on your own dev environment, aren't you?) like this:

update users set mail=concat("randy+",uid,"@randyfay.com")

Gmail lets you add a "+" and anything to the name part of your email. So this will make all
the emails in the database go to randy+<uid>@randyfay.com. That way you don't have to worry 
so much about bogus emails going out.


Cron issues

When debugging the sending of mail you may terminate a session before the cron hooks have 
a chance to unregister. This will leave drupal unwilling to run cron. To clean up if this
happens, you can issue these sql commands:
  delete from variable where name like "cron_%";
  truncate cache;
